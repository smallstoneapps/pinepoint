### Pine Point Pebble Watchface

This is a custom watchface for the [Pebble Smartwatch][1].

The watchface was comissioned by *Rush Hambleton* for use whist teaching at [Pine Point School][2].

The original proposal docment for the watchface can be found at http://dft.ba/-pinepointproposal. 

After testing, the vibration periods were reduced as specified [in this image][4].

The watchface displays the number of minutes left before the end of each school period, using an easy to read grid of 40 blocks, each representing one minute.

At specified times the watch will vibrate to indicate the number of minutes remaining.

#### Install

You can install this watchface by clicking [this link][3] on the Android or iOS device that you have paired to your Pebble watch.
