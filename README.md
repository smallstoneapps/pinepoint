Pine Point Pebble Watch App
================

This is a custom watch app for the [Pebble Smartwatch][1]. This watch app was comissioned by *Rush Hambleton* for use whist teaching at *[Pine Point School][2]*.

The original proposal docment for the watch app can be found at http://dft.ba/-pinepointproposal.

The app displays the number of minutes left before the end of each school period, using an easy to read grid of 40 blocks, each representing one minute.

At specified times the watch will vibrate to indicate the number of minutes remaining.
